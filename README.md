# CreateADUsers

## createusers.py

### Description
This script generates a list of random user profiles for a fictional company. It is meant to be used for the creation of user profiles for a test Microsoft Active Directory/Domain Controller service.  

This is so that someone can quickly generate profiles and import them into AD so that they can begin working on test Group Policies without breaking their production environments.

The script creates user data by randomly selecting departments, job titles, and office locations.  
    
The departments are based around common departments a person would encounter in most technology-based organizations. The departments also have job-titles that are fitting to each department.

This script also generates random first and last names, as well as emails based on the company and domain name generated by it.  A random password is also generated for each user.

The generated user data is stored in a list, which is then written to a CSV file named 'random_users.csv' for importing later by a powershell script. This file is generated in whatever directory the script is stored in.

This script prompts the user for the number of users to generate and ensures that no two users have the same SamAccountName. This makes sure that there are no issues when bulk importing these accounts.

### Dependencies
- `faker`: A library to generate random names and sentences.
- `random`: Used for generating random job titles, office locations, and password components.
- `string`: For generating password characters.
- `os`: Used for file operations (checking and removing the existing CSV file).

### Usage
```
python createusers.py
```

## addusers.ps1

### Description
This script imports a list of user account details from a CSV file and creates corresponding Active Directory user accounts.
It validates prerequisites, including administrative privileges, operating system type, and input data formats, before attempting
to create accounts. Accounts are created with attributes such as display name, email address, department, and more.

### Dependencies
- `ActiveDirectory`: A PowerShell module that allows you to automate and manage Active Directory objects (users, groups, computers, and domains)
- Windows Server OS: This is needed since this script manages Active Directory and is only available on Windows Server.
- Active Directory Domain Controller: manages authentication, authorization, and directory services within a Windows domain, serving as the backbone for centralized user and resource management.
- Administrative Privileges: The user running this script needs to have admin priviliges because it is modifying active directory and creating new user accounts.

### Usage
```
.\addusers.ps1 -CsvPath "random_users.csv" -Domain "example.com"
```
