# CreateADUsers

## createusers.py

### Description
This script generates a list of random user profiles for a fictional company. It is meant to be used for the creation of user profiles for a test Microsoft Active Directory/Domain Controller service.  

This is so that someone can quickly generate profiles and import them into AD so that they can begin working on test Group Policies without breaking their production environments.

The script creates user data by randomly selecting departments, job titles, and office locations.  
    
The departments are based around common departments a person would encounter in most technology-based organizations. The departments also have job-titles that are fitting to each department.

This script also generates random first and last names, as well as emails based on the company and domain name generated by it.  A random password is also generated for each user.

The generated user data is stored in a list, which is then written to a CSV file named 'random_users.csv' for importing later by a powershell script. This file is generated in whatever directory the script is stored in.

This script prompts the user for the number of users to generate and ensures that no two users have the same SamAccountName. This makes sure that there are no issues when bulk importing these accounts.

### Dependencies
- `faker`: A library to generate random names and sentences.
- `random`: Used for generating random job titles, office locations, and password components.
- `string`: For generating password characters.
- `os`: Used for file operations (checking and removing the existing CSV file).
