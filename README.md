# CreateADUsers

CreateADUsers provides a powerful framework generating and deploying test user data in an Active Directory environment. These scripts save time, reduce errors, and provide flexibility for testers, IT departments, and homelabbers alike. 

Whether you're testing a new system, onboarding employees, or experimenting in a homelab, these scripts are a valuable tool for managing user data efficiently.

## Prerequisites
- Active Directory Environment:
    - A Windows Server with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and configured.
    - Administrative access to the domain.
- PowerShell:
    - PowerShell 5.1 or later installed on the server.
    - The Active Directory module for PowerShell (installed via RSAT-AD-PowerShell).
- Python:
    - Python 3.x installed (for running the user generation script).
    - The faker library installed (pip install faker).
- Permissions:
    - Administrative privileges on the server to create AD users.
    - Write permissions to the directory where the CSV file will be saved.

- Basic Knowledge:
    - Familiarity with PowerShell and Python scripting.
    - Understanding of Active Directory user management concepts.

Installation

## Usage

The two scripts provided are designed to work together to quickly create and import Active Directory (AD) user accounts in a test environment. 

The first script, `createusers.ps1`, generates randomized CSV data for AD user attributes such as first name, last name, email address, job title, department, etc. 

The second script, `addusers.ps1`, takes the CSV file generated by the first script and uses it to create new AD user accounts in a specified domain.

### createusers.py

This script creates random users and their associated data, including a SamAccountName, email address, and password. The script 
can be run with any number of users as an argument, and will create that many users in a CSV file called "random_users.csv". The 
script uses the Faker library to generate fake data for each user, and the random module to randomly select a department and 
office location.

#### Dependencies

The script requires the following dependencies:

- faker
- random
- sys
- os
- string

#### Example

To use this script, simply run it with an integer as an argument representing the number of users you want to create. For 
example, to create 10 users, you can run the script as follows:

```bash
python3 createusers.py 10
```

The script will create a CSV file called "random_users.csv" in the current working directory, containing the generated user data. 
You can open this file using a spreadsheet program or other tool to view and manipulate the data.

### addusers.ps1

This script imports a list of user account details from a CSV file and creates corresponding Active Directory user accounts.
It validates prerequisites, including administrative privileges, operating system type, and input data formats, before attempting
to create accounts. Accounts are created with attributes such as display name, email address, department, and more.

#### Dependencies

- Windows Server 
- Administrative Privileges
- Active Directory Module for PowerShell
- Domain-Joined Machine
- PowerShell 5.1 or newer

#### Example

```bash
.\addusers.ps1 -CsvPath "C:\path\to\random_users.csv" -Domain "example.com"
```

If successful:

```
All users created successfully!
```

If some users fail to create:

```
Some users failed to create:
User       Error
----       -----
jsmith     The specified user already exists
```
